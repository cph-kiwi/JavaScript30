      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age; // age2 is a copy of age

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      team[3] = "Lux"; // team is a reference to the original array, which is players.
      // When you edit the original array, it's going to go back to the reference and change that too.
      // This has changed both team and players.
      console.log(players, team);
      // What we really want to do is make a copy of the array and then update it.

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      const team2 = players.slice(); // Slice takes a copy of the entire array when nothing is passed in. Returns entire array
      console.log(players.slice(2, 3));
      console.log(team2);

      team2[3] = "Beth"; // updated team2 but not players
      console.log(team2, players);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const team3 = [].concat(players); // creates a new array
      console.log(team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team4 = [...players];
      console.log(team4);
      team4[3] = "Andreas"; // team4 has been updated and players remains unchanged
      console.log(team4, players);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      console.log(team5);
      team5[3] = "Dahlia";
      console.log(team5, players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99; // person has also been changed
      console.log(captain, person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
        name: "Andreas",
        number: 50,
        age: 40,
      });
      // Here we are taking a blank object, copying in the details from person, and then changing them in the third arguement.
      console.log(captain2, person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      const captain3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },

      // To make a copy of wes...

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      console.log(dev);
      dev.name = "Wesley"; // dev is changed, but Wes isn't. Dev is a copy, not a reference.
      console.log(dev);

      console.log(dev.social);
      dev.social.twitter = "@coolman"; // this changes both dev and wes.
      // because when you do Object.assign it only does one level deep.
      // you would need to go online and find a function called cloneDeep to make a clone to avoid this problem.
      console.log(dev.social);
      console.log(wes.social);

      // Poor man's deep clone...
